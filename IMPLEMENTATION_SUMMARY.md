## How to Use

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Import Postman Collection**
   - Open Postman
   - Import `LMS_API_Postman_Collection.json`
   - Set base URL variable (default: http://localhost:8080)

3. **Create Data in Order**
   ```

   2. Create User Profiles (Teachers & Students)
   3. Create Classes (assign teachers)
   4. Enroll Students in Classes
   ```

4. **Use Filters**
   - Get all students in a school: `GET /user-profiles?schoolId=1&role=STUDENT`
   - Get all classes for grade 10: `GET /classes?grade=10`
   - Get students in a class: `GET /class-students?classId=1`
